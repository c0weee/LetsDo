<strong>About Where’s the Dark</strong>

  
Where’s the Dark is a productivity app which mixes elements of gacha games (toy vending machine mechanic) to motivate users to complete their tasks. 

Users are able to create a todo list, which is stored in the cloud (Firebase) so that it can be accessed across multiple devices. Upon completing their tasks, they will be rewarded with ‘pet(s)’. The more challenging the tasks are, the rarer the reward.
